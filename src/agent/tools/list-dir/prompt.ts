Usage:
- The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- Returns entries with their name, path, type (file/directory/symlink/other), size (for files), and children count (for directories)
- Results are sorted alphabetically by name
- Use includeHidden to include dotfiles and dot-directories (defaults to false)
- Results are paginated with the limit parameter (defaults to 200, max 1000)
- The truncated flag indicates if there were more entries than the limit
- The totalCount field shows the total number of entries before pagination`;
