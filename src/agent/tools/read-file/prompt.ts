    return `Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.

Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to ${maxLinesToRead} lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- This tool reads text files. Binary formats such as images, audio, video, archives, and office documents are rejected.
- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) are returned as raw file contents only; notebook cells and outputs are not parsed into a richer structure.
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use the listDir tool.
- Paths to screenshots or other binary image files will be rejected by this tool because they are not text files.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.`;
